# 311-San-Diego

### Project Proposal:
Use 311 call data from City of San Diego to answer these questions:
* What are the major concerns of citizens
* What is the distribution of 311 complaint in each zip code in San Diego
* Is there any relation between the number of 311 calls per population, income bracket, crime rate
* How do different neighborhoods in San Diego that vary in household income differ in the types of 311 calls

#### We can collect our data from [City of San Diego](https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/get-it-done-311) and [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/data.html)
