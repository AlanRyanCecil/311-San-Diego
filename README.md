# 311-San-Diego

### Project Proposal:
Use 311 call data from City of San Diego to answer these questions:
* 1. What are the major concerns of citizens
* 2. What is the distribution of 311 complaint in each zip code in San Diego
* 3. Is there any relation between the number of 311 calls per population, income bracket, crime rate
* 4. How do different neighborhoods in San Diego that vary in household income differ in the types of 311 calls

#### We can get our data from City of San Diego and US Census Bureau
